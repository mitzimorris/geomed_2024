For this workshop, we are using the CmdStan-based interfaces CmdStanR and CmdStanPy.
Please install the interface for your preferred language.


## Prerequisites: C++ Toolchain

Compiling a Stan program requires a modern C++ compiler and the GNU Make build utility (a.k.a. “gmake”). These vary by operating system.


### Linux

On most systems the GNU Make utility is pre-installed and is the default `make` utility.
There is usually a pre-installed C++ compiler as well, however, it may not be new enough.
To check your machine, run commands:

```bash
g++ --version
make --version
```

If these are at least at `g++` version 4.9.3 or later and
`make` version 3.81 or later, no additional installations are
necessary. It may still be desirable to update the C++ compiler `g++`, because later versions are faster.

A modern C++ compiler and GNU make are  are bundled into the meta-package `build-essential`,
and can be installed via the command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# then rerun checks
g++ --version
make --version
```

### Mac

* On Mac, the Clang compiler and GNU Make are included with Xcode, the Apple toolset for software developers.
Install Xcode from the App Store and then run command:\
`xcode-select --install`


### Windows

On Windows, there are two ways to get a Stan-compatible C++ toolchain:

* Use the conda installer for CmdStan, CmdStanPy or CmdStanR or RStan, since these packages all include the required toolchain.

* Get [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"}
which includes a C++17 compiler, GNU Make for windows, and a few Unix utilities.\
CmdStanR users can call the internal function `cmdstanr:::install_toolchain`.\
CmdStanPy provides both the function `cmdstanpy::get_cxx_toolchain` and command line script `get_cxx_toolchain`.


## CmdStanR Installation Instructions

All Stan R packages, including CmdStanR, are available from RUniverse.

In a fresh R session, run this command

```r
install.packages(c("cmdstanr", "posterior", "loo", "bayesplot"),
                           repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))
```

Next, use CmdStanR to download, build CmdStan

```r
library(cmdstanr)
install_cmdstan()

# check the installation
cmdstan_version()
cmdstan_path()
```

See CmdStanR documentation:  https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html#installing-cmdstan


To check your work, compile and run the example model included with the CmdStan distribution.

```r
library(cmdstanr)
stan_file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.stan")
data_file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.data.json")

bernoulli_mod <- cmdstan_model(stan_file=stan_file)
bernoulli_fit <- bernoulli_mod$sample(data=data_file)

bernoulli_fit
```

Expected console output for the final command:

```r
> bernoulli_fit
 variable  mean median   sd  mad    q5   q95 rhat ess_bulk ess_tail
    lp__  -7.28  -6.99 0.74 0.33 -8.82 -6.75 1.00     1883     2193
    theta  0.25   0.24 0.12 0.12  0.07  0.47 1.00     1260     1458
```

### Troubleshooting

If installing CmdStanR into your current R environment fails, the fastest way to a CmdStanR installation is to use [Anaconda or miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/packages/using-r-language/)
and [create a new environment for CmdStanR](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/packages/using-r-language/#creating-a-new-environment-with-r).

(@) Install miniconda (installs faster than Anaconda).\
Installation instructions: [https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/)

(@) Open a new terminal window, check that conda has been installed\
```bash
conda --version
```


(@) Create a new environment for R\
```r
conda create -n cmdstanr -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials r-cmdstanr
conda activate cmdstanr
```

(@) From within this conda environment, i.e., the same terminal session, start R or R Studio Desktop and try again to run the following:\
```r
library(cmdstanr)
stan_file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.stan")
data_file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.data.json")

bernoulli_mod <- cmdstan_model(stan_file=stan_file)
bernoulli_fit <- bernoulli_mod$sample(data=data_file)

bernoulli_fit
```


## CmdStanPy Installation Instructions

CmdStanPy is available both through [PyPi](pypi.org) as well as from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).


### Install from PyPi

```python
pip install cmdstanpy
```

CmdStanPy provides the function `cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan()` which downloads
CmdStan from GitHub and builds the CmdStan utilities.
It can be can be called from within Python or from the command line.
The default install location is a hidden directory in the user's `$HOME` directory named `.cmdstan`.
This directory will be created as needed by the `install_cmdstan()` function.

```python
import cmdstanpy
cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan()
```


### Install from conda-forge

If you use conda, you can install CmdStanPy and the underlying CmdStan components from the conda-forge repository.
If you want to create a new conda environment (recommended):

```python
conda create -n stan -c conda-forge cmdstanpy
conda activate stan
```

If you want to install into your existing environment:

```python
conda install -c conda-forge cmdstanpy
```

By default, the latest release of CmdStan is installed.
For further details, see the [CmdStanPy installation instructions](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/installation.html).


### Check the installation

To check your work, compile and run the example model included with the CmdStan distribution.

```python
import os
from cmdstanpy import CmdStanModel, cmdstan_path
stan_file = os.path.join(cmdstan_path(), 'examples', 'bernoulli', 'bernoulli.stan')
data_file = os.path.join(cmdstan_path(), 'examples', 'bernoulli', 'bernoulli.data.json')

bernoulli_mod = CmdStanModel(stan_file=stan_file)
bernoulli_fit = bernoulli_mod.sample(data=data_file)
bernoulli_fit.summary().round(3)
```

Expected console output for the final command:

```python
 bernoulli_fit.summary().round(3)
        Mean   MCSE  StdDev     5%    50%   95%    N_Eff  N_Eff/s  R_hat
